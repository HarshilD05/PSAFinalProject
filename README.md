University Time-Table Scheduling using  Genetic-Algorithm
Team Member â€“ Harshil Dudhat, Ruchi Niwalkar, Nikita Gundyal

Introduction
Genetic Algorithms are a family of algorithms whose purpose is to solve problems more efficiently than usual standard algorithms by using natural science metaphors with parts of the algorithm being strongly inspired by natural evolutionary behavior; such as the concept of mutation, crossover and natural selection.

Problem Statement
To design a timetable for classes in a college, we have to arrange classes and come up with a timetable so that there are no clashes between classes. So task is to search for the optimum timetable schedule. In this project, we are going to solve schedule problem by using genetic algorithm. 
         The time table-scheduling problem class scheduler creates a college timetable based on data we provide it, such as the available professors, available rooms, timeslots and student groups. Grade school timetables require their students to have a full timetable of scheduled classes throughout the day with no free periods. Conversely, typical college timetables will frequently have free periods depending  on how many modules the student enrolls in. Each class will be assigned a timeslot, a professor, a room and a student group by the class scheduler. We can calculate the total number of classes that will need scheduling by summing the number of students groups multiplied by the number of modules each student group is enrolled in by considering certain hard and soft constraints.

 How to run the project
a.	Main Program
        Run the UniversityTimetableScheduling.java (Main for the program ) which is in university.timetable.scheduling.main package.
b.	Test Cases
        Run the GeneticAlgorithmTest.java for the Junit test cases which is present in university.timetable.scheduling.test package
